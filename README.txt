WELCOME, this is my year 1 into to programming Coursework! Emmanuel Adio  - F229639
Quick Breifing on all my modules and sections!

MainMenu/ GUI:
Menu system works perfectly well there is no issue for the user to select any menu option.
when I was working on Embedding the graphs into the GUI i came a cross a problem with all my text on screan shrinking!
i did not fix this problem beacuse it allows everything to fit on screen but a quick !DISCLAIMER! for best experience
with my program please put the window on full screen so everything can be veiwed properly thank you

BookSearch:
this works perfectly well thers is no issue here. user provides the book title they are looking for, and program displays 
to them all the book copies and information they have with that book title.

BookCheckOut:
This also works very well, the Memebr Id that the user had inputted at the start of the program is used to allow the user to checkout 
books from the library after they have given the ID of the book they want to chek out. it alos alows teh user to reenter the member ID
by opening the member ID tab.

BookReturn:
This works perfectly, allowing the user to enter the ID of the book that they want to return, ignores MemeberID, and siaplaying the correct 
message on how the process goes.

BookSelect:
in this section it works almost perfectly it shows teh user the activity of all teh books in the libraray system through out the year when the activity graph if showed,
this is if teh librarian wants to know when it is best to buy new book in the year.
it is also able show the popularity of each genre of books in the genre graph, and is able to fufill all the other things mentioned in the specification as well and more...

!!DISCLAIMER!!
when running program and you return a book or checkout a book it does not update the graph in
select section during that run, u need to rerun the program and the selct section to get the new updated graph!

Also if the budget the librarian enters is lower than the most popular book's price then the budget will become negative and distribute a negative amount of money
next time i will try and add more validation for the budget!SS

Thank You!
